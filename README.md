# CSS Animation Sequencer

CSS animations are pretty great but often one wants to chain together some animations on one or more elements. Enter the CSS Animation Sequencer.

# Builds

Until I get this published, clone the repo, `yarn`, and then `yarn build`. That will generate a `dist` folder with CommonJS, ES Module, IIFE, and UMD builds in both minified and unminified versions. Pick the one that works best for you and your toolchain.

# Development

Use `yarn watch` to build on changes. `yarn docs` to run an HTTP server on the docs directory which is used for Github Pages.
